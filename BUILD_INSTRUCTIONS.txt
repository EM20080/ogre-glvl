OGRE 1.12.13 - Windows Release Build for SonicGLvl
====================================================

This is a minimal Windows-only distribution of OGRE configured specifically for SonicGLvl.

INCLUDED COMPONENTS:
-------------------
- OgreMain (Core library)
- RenderSystem_Direct3D9
- RenderSystem_Direct3D11
- Plugin_OctreeSceneManager
- OgreBites (Application framework)
- OgreOverlay (2D overlay system with ImGui support)
- OgreRTShaderSystem (Runtime shader system)

REQUIREMENTS:
------------
- Windows operating system
- Visual Studio 2015 or later
- CMake 3.15 or later
- DirectX SDK (included in Windows SDK for Windows 8.0+)

RECOMMENDED: Install dependencies via vcpkg
-------------------------------------------
The easiest way to get all dependencies is using vcpkg:

1. Install vcpkg if you don't have it:
   git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
   cd vcpkg
   .\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat

2. Install required packages:
   .\vcpkg install zlib:x64-windows freetype:x64-windows zziplib:x64-windows

3. Integrate vcpkg with Visual Studio:
   .\vcpkg integrate install

4. When opening the OGRE folder in Visual Studio, it will automatically find the dependencies

ALTERNATIVE: Build dependencies automatically
---------------------------------------------
Set OGRE_BUILD_DEPENDENCIES=ON in CMake and it will download and build zlib, zziplib, and freetype automatically.

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:
------------------
1. Open the folder in Visual Studio (File > Open > Folder)
2. Wait for CMake to automatically configure the project
3. Select your desired build configuration (x64-Debug, x64-Release, x64-RelWithDebInfo)
4. Build > Build All (Ctrl+Shift+B)

The built libraries will be in:
- Bin/x64-<Config>/Bin/ - DLLs and runtime files
- Bin/x64-<Config>/Lib/ - Import libraries (.lib files)

Example: x64-Release output goes to:
  - Bin/x64-Release/Bin/ (DLLs)
  - Bin/x64-Release/Lib/ (LIBs)

CMake will automatically detect DirectX and configure the build.
All unnecessary components have been removed for a clean, fast build.

WHAT WAS REMOVED:
----------------
- OpenGL/OpenGL ES render systems
- Metal render system (iOS/macOS)
- Mobile platforms (Android, iOS, Emscripten)
- Language bindings (Python, Java, C#)
- Sample applications
- Command-line tools
- Unit tests
- Unused plugins (BSP, ParticleFX, PCZ, DotScene, Assimp, Cg, image codecs)
- Unused components (Terrain, Paging, Volume, Property, HLMS, MeshLodGenerator)
